## Product Summary
  In this day and age, environmental issues should be prioritized as we progress as a
society. Our web application offers a solution to getting regular citizens and elected officials
involved in working together to troubleshoot the environment in a familiar way. Our platform,
TrashPosters, allows people to communicate issues in a way people are already familiar with
about environment hazards with each other and also to get in contact with city officials on ways
to resolve complaints that would otherwise pile high on an unpaid intern’s inbox in city hall. Our
product allows city officials to have their own unique accounts in order to post official statements
about environmental issues in their jurisdiction. Citizens will be informed and kept in the loop
with what’s going on in their area.

  City Officials being on the site will attract users through advertising done by the City
Officials. The City Officials could advertise the site as a place to receive up-to-date information
on the current environmental status of the city. This will keep unregistered and registered users
in the loop with their city. Users will also be attracted to our platform because the city officials
will legitimize the service. TrashPosters won’t just be a site where people complain, but a site
where citizens and the city work together to clean up and help the environment.

  We aim to build a visually appealing web application that will incentivize its users to visit
on a daily basis by gamifying being active in the community by mimicking a social network
scheme, something most internet users today are already familiar with. Instead of giving the
users a chore with the feel of doing government paperwork, users shall be able to post quickly
and easily to provide the government information about the environment and get in contact with
city officials. Furthermore, users shall be able to search for results relevant to their communities
and shall be given an opportunity to comment on local issues or subscribe to environmental
news local to their area. Lastly, users shall be given an opportunity to personalize their own
profile and get to know other community members and leaders in their neighborhood that they
would otherwise never interact with.
